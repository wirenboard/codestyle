Wiren Board Embedded C Style Guide
========================

The following sheet describes few recomodations in order to make an easy to read
and well organised program code focusing on C programming language convenstions what can be
different from C++ conventions.

## Marking and Parenthesis
These are similar those what we have got used in C++. Read more in: https://github.com/contactless/codestyle. 

## Naming
In embedded C we don't follow CamelCase style however we use snake_case. At snake_case style function and variable names can
include **only lower case characters**, like *snake_case* (even though officially upper case characters are also allowed) and words must be separated by underscore character (_). 

## Library naming
1. When you add a new module to your project you should put it in a new library. 
2. Please avoid libraries like: *peripherals.h*.
3. Library names should describe the module behind the code. Use *mcp230xx.h* isntead of *gpio_chip.h*
4. Try to separate module funtionalities, in order to support your code reusability. Better to implement basic IC
  related functions in one library, and write task specific functions in an other library. Like: *mcp230xx.h* includes
  driver to chip and *wbio-dio.h" library is using functions of *mcp230xx.h".
  
## Function names
Since in C is no option to use namespace or classes, somehow you should mark your function's library and avoid this kind of
program code in *main.c*:
```C
int pin_value = read_value_digit();//function for module1
set_config(CONFIG_1);              //function for module2
```
Better to mark library name as a prefix for each function even if it is a static function and used only in the given
library:
```C
int pin_value = mcp230xx_read_gpio();
ads1015_set_config(ADS_CONFIG_1);
```
It is also true for *defines* where you should mark where is it defined:
```C
#define MCP23008_IODIR                  0x00
#define MCP23008_IPOL                   0x01
#define MCP23008_GPINTEN                0x02
#define MCP23008_DEFVAL                 0x03
#define MCP23008_INTCON                 0x04
```

## Declarations
1. Functions what is not supposed be called from outside of library should be defined as *static*.
2. Static function prototypes should be in *.c* file, because it is related to implementation not to usage.
3. *#defines* used only in *.c* also should be placed in *.c* file.
4. In header file should be *defines* and functions what are necessary to use library.
5. Avoid using hardcoded constants because first, they are not describing their functionality, second harder to modify all
if once it must be. Avoid this:
```C
uint16_t gpio_config = mcp230xx_read_config();
if (gpio_config & 0x04) {
...
```
Better to use *define* and replace magic constant.
```C
#define MCP230xx_REG_IOCON_BANK (1 << 2)
...
uint16_t gpio_config = mcp230xx_read_config();
if (gpio_config & MCP230xx_REG_IOCON_BANK) {
...
```

## C Macros

Using of C preproccessor is generally discouraged because it makes source code hard to read and mantain.

Whenever possible, please use C language features instead.

Common use cases for C macros include:

* `#define`-ing constants, for instance, array sizes, configuration parameters, register addresses or so on. 
* switching on and off particular chunks of firmware via `#if` and friends. Prefereable done at module level.
* compile-time magic otherwise impossible to implement. Say, altering of control flow in coroutines or implementing assert. Try to limit it to few low-level libraries.

If expressions are used in macro, they must be wrapped in `do {} while (0)`. 
Function-like macros should follow function-like calling semantics. Consider `START_TIMER();` instead of `START_TIMER;`.

All macros must be named in `CAPITAL` letters.

Please consider the following alternatives to C preprocessor:
* `if`s with condition evaluating to `true` at compile time insted of `#if`s
* `const` variables instead of `#define`s
* `static inline` functions instead of macros containing expressions.
